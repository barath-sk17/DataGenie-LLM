# CSV Partitioning Utility

## Overview
This Python script `partition_csv.py` is designed to partition a large CSV file into smaller files with a specified number of rows per file. This can be useful for breaking down large datasets into more manageable chunks, especially when dealing with memory constraints or when processing the data in parallel.

## Usage
1. **Input File**: The script expects a CSV file as input. Make sure to specify the path to the input CSV file using the `input_file` variable.
   
2. **Output Folder**: Define the folder where the partitioned CSV files will be saved. Specify the path to the output folder using the `output_folder` variable.

3. **Rows per File**: Optionally, you can specify the number of rows per file for partitioning. By default, each output file will contain 1000 rows, but you can adjust this value by modifying the `rows_per_file` parameter in the `partition_csv` function.

4. **Running the Script**: Simply execute the script `partition_csv.py`. It will read the input CSV file, partition it into smaller CSV files based on the specified number of rows per file, and save them in the output folder.

## Example
```bash
python partition_csv.py
```

## Example Output
Suppose you have a large CSV file named `SalesUseCase-V1.csv`. After running the script, it will create a folder named `Sales-Datagen` (if it doesn't exist already) and save the partitioned CSV files inside it. The output files will be named `output_1.csv`, `output_2.csv`, etc., each containing the specified number of rows.
